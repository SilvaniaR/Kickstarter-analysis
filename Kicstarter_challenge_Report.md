# An Analysis on How Different Kickstarter Campaigns Performed

## The client asked to reasearch how diffrent campaings performed based on the lauch date and funding goals.

### The purpose for this analysis is to see what affected outcomes of the campaigns based on funding goals and launch date.

## The analysis for outcomes based on goals, we use the countifs formula to look at specific criteria to compare how succesful or unsuccedsful campaigns were based on the funding goals. For the analysis based on launched date we used a pivot table with filter to drill down the data set to see if there was any trends related to the time of year that would affect a campaigns to be successful vs not. Both analysis were put on a chart to visualize the outcomes.

### The only challenge/ difficulty during this analysis was figuring out the counifs formula based on the criteria. Took me a few try before I understood how it works. 

## Results

- Two conclusion can  be drawn from the Outcomes based on launch date the time of year has no affect on the canceled campaigns for "Partent catefory: Theater." You can also conclude that for both successful and failed campaigns they both peak at the month of MAY but both type had equal succesful and failed campaings for the month of DEC.

- After analyzing the the data for the outcome based on goal is clear that the higher the funding goal the more likely that campaign will fail same can be said, the lower the fundung goal the most likely it will be a successful campaign. 

- Limiation for this dateset were missing dates, it required for added column to work around the original data set to be able create a table the represents the analysis.

- Other Charts/ graphs i would of recommended would of been the stacked bar graph for the Outcome by launch date and the for the goal based I would of recommended a pie chart for each goal range although is labor intensive.
